      <description>So I thought I’d make my first post here about the process for me, a non-web-developer, non-guru-nor-R-master to create this blog, host it, and then tie it to this domain. TL;DR not 100% smooth for the truest of noobs, but mostly painless.
I’ll quickly name off the steps that I took after reading Yihui’s blogdown book, found here. You honestly don’t need to read this post to make a blogdown blog, and of course there are other ways to go about this also mentioned in the book, but I’m just documenting some things that I’ve done, personally.</description>
